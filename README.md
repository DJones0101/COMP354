## Assignment 1

Consider Problem 1.9(c) :Implement Euclidâ€™s Extended algorithm and run an experiment to verify this claim.

There is a typo: instead of  ```min{m,n}```, it should be ```min{(m)_b,(n)_b}```, that is, the running time ought to be bound in terms of the length of the binary encoding of the inputs, not their value.
