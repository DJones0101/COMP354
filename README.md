## Assignment 1

Consider Problem 1.9(c) :Implement Euclidâ€™s Extended algorithm and run an experiment to verify this claim.

There is a typo: instead of  ```min{m,n}```, it should be ```min{(m)_b,(n)_b}```, that is, the running time ought to be bound in terms of the length of the binary encoding of the inputs, not their value.

The relationship between number of steps and binary lenght is shown by the graph below:
